    <p>Stan is open source because we want your input to help make
  Stan's code and documentation better.</p>

  <h2>Suggest or Discuss Code Patches</h2>

  <p>To suggest or discuss small patches, such as localized bug fixes, the users group
  is the best venue.  For larger patches, the discussion should move to
  the developers group.</p>
  

  <h2>Contribute Code Patches</h2>

  <p>If you'd like to contribute code, please submit it through a Git
  pull request.  The developer process for creating a Git pull request
  is described on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="external"
    href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Developer-Process">Developer
    Process Wiki</a><img class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external link
    marker"/>
    <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p> After code review, testing, and merging, all code is distributed
  under the same open-source license of the package to which it
  belongs (GPL for RStan, PyStan; BSD for CmdStan, C++ API; CC
  BY for documentation).</p>

  <h2>Contribute Models and Data</h2>

  <p>We're still discussing how to support user-contributed
  models. The issues to sort out are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>how to vet the models to make sure they work,</li>
    <li>how to handle intellectual property and licensing, and</li>
    <li>how to store and distribute them.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have suggestions, let us know on the users group.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to discuss models and provide links and
  references on the users group.</p>
    
  <h2>To Do List and Projects</h2>

  <p>Larger project design documents and goals, as well as the
  developer process followed by Stan, are listed in various places on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="external"
    href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki">Stan Wiki</a><img
    class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external link
    marker"/>
    <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <p>There is a top-level list that is in the process of being moved
  over to the <a class="internal" href="issues.html">issue tracker</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="external"
    href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/To-Do-List">To-Do List
    Wiki</a><img
    class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external link
    marker"/>
    <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2>Join the Development Team</h2>

  <p>The Stan development team is always looking for developers
  willing to get their hands dirty with C++, R, or Python design,
  coding, documentation, testing, and maintenance.</p>

  <p>The current list of bugs and feature requests we would like to
  implement is available on the <a class="internal"
  href="issues.html">issue tracker</a>.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to join the development team and gain push access
  to the Stan code repository, please let us know by first requesting
  to join the <a class="internal" href="groups.html">developers group</a>.
  Please include a brief description of your programming background
  and what you'd like to contribute.</p>
